\begin{frame}[t]{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Performance of workloads with scalar and vector phases suffers from AVX reclocking
		\item We want to find improvements to the reclocking behavior
		\item Intel's claims about the algorithm are not accurate
		\item Improvements for heterogeneous workloads are theoretically possible
		\begin{itemize}
			\item up to \SI{15}{\percent} performance increase
		\end{itemize}
		\item Possibilities for software reimplementation are limited
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Still a potentially promising approach
			\item Improvements likely possible
		\end{itemize}
